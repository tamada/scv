## :speaking_head: Overview

`scv` supports simpson, jaccard, dice, cosine, pearson, euclidean, manhattan, and chebyshev algorithms.
Those algorithms separated into two categories, similarities, and distances.
The followings describes each algorithms and how to calculate similarity/distance from two vectors.



## Similarities

### Simpson index

### Jaccard index

### Dice index

### Cosine similarity

### Pearson correlation efficiency

## Distances

### Euclidean Distance

### Manhattan Distance

### Chebyshev Distance
